title: Poligon Language IR again
---

In the November 21st post, I created a PLIR aimed to make LLVM IR compilation easier. The guarantees that made things easier to parse were...
- Typing is explicit for declarations, function declarations, and expressions. (Basically, no implicit typing.)
- Pattern matching is expanded. All declarations and assignments are of the form:
```rust
// declarations:
let identifier = expression;

// assignments:
identifier = expression;
identifier[1] = expression;
identifier.a.b.c = expression;
```

There was a third guarantee (short-circuiting is broken into if-else statements), but I have decided to put that on hold.

I have added another guarantee:
- Blocks must explicitly end with a terminating statement.

There are four terminating statements in PLIR: `return`, `break`, `continue`, `exit`.

The first 3 are as you would expect:
- `return [expr]`: Return the value out of whatever function the expression is currently in
- `break`: Exit the loop the expression is currently in
- `continue`: Exit the current iteration of the loop the expression is currently in and continue onto the next iteration
The last is a simple exit:
- `exit [expr]`: Return out of the block. Can be implicit.

Here is an example:
```rust
fun main() -> int {
	let a = if true {
		return 2;
		false;
	} else {
		1;
	};

	a
}

// deconstructs into
fun main() -> int <int>{
	let a: int = <int>if <bool>true <never>{
		return <int>2;
		// false;
	} else <int>{
		<int>1; // implicit exit
	};

	a; // implicit exit
}
```

Note that the extraneous statements are removed since the terminating statement already occurred.
